      <h2>Planting Hope in Our School</h2>
      <p><strong>By:</strong> Viana Izza Khe</p>
      <p>
        On a bright Saturday morning, the school grounds buzzed with excitement—not from the usual classroom chatter, but from the sound of shovels digging into soil and laughter echoing as students and teachers worked side by side. It was Tree Planting Day, an event that turned the campus into a living classroom for environmental care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of sitting behind desks, students got their hands dirty, planting young trees and learning firsthand about the patience and effort required to nurture life. For many, it was their first time planting a tree, and the experience quickly became both fun and meaningful. “I never realized how much care a small tree needs,” one student said, wiping soil from her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The activity emphasized more than just environmental responsibility. Classmates helped each other dig, plant, and water, turning the morning’s hard work into a collaborative and memorable experience. Teachers guided the students, explaining how each small action—like planting a single sapling—contributes to a greener, healthier future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the event lasted only a few hours, its impact is expected to grow for years to come. As the young trees take root and flourish, they will serve as a living reminder that small steps, when taken together, can create lasting change. Tree Planting Day was not just about planting trees—it was about planting hope, responsibility, and a sense of shared purpose among the school community.

      <h2>Editorial Article Title</h2>
      <p><strong>By:</strong> Magdalene Ibanez</p>
      <p>
      <p> Animal testing has been a part of scientific research, from developing new medicines to testing cosmetic products. While it has contributed to important medical breakthroughs, it raises serious ethical questions about treatment of animals. Is the advancement of science enough to justify the suffering of living creatures?</p>

      <p>Many scientists argue that animal testing is necessary for medical progress. Vaccines, cancer treatments, and surgical procedures have all benefited from research conducted on animals. They claim that animal models provide insights that cannot yet be fully replicated through computers or cell cultures. Without animal testing, some life-saving discoveries might never have been possible.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, modern science is offering alternatives. Computer simulations, 3D tissue models, and cell cultures are becoming more accurate and accessible. These methods can reduce, and in some cases replace, the need for live animal testing. Scientists, governments, and institutions are beginning to prioritize these alternatives, promoting research that is both innovative and ethical.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, animal testing might have helped science, but it still harms animals and we should focus on finding ways that don't harm them. True progress shouldn't come at the cost of poor innocent lives.</p>

      <h2>School Conducts Earthquake Drill to Strengthen Emergency Preparedness</h2>
      <p><strong>By:</strong> Hananiah Mishael Lavisores</p>
      <p>
        The school conducted an earthquake drill on Tuesday morning to strengthen emergency preparedness among students and staff. The activity involved all grade levels and was organized by the school administration in coordination with teachers and safety officers.
      </p>
      <p>
      <p>When the emergency alarm sounded, students immediately performed the “duck, cover, and hold” procedure inside their classrooms. After the simulated shaking ended, teachers led their classes to designated evacuation areas within the school campus. Attendance checks were conducted to confirm that all students and staff were safely accounted for.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
      <p> School officials explained that the drill was intended to familiarize students with proper earthquake safety measures and to evaluate the school’s existing emergency response plan. Observers monitored the flow of evacuation and noted areas for improvement, including movement along stairways and assembly procedures.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
      <p> The activity was completed without incident. School administrators emphasized the importance of conducting regular emergency drills to maintain safety awareness and ensure an organized response in the event of an actual earthquake.</p>

      <h2>School Bowlers Strike Victory in Friendly Tournament</h2>
      <p><strong>By:</strong> Zackary Edward Leyson</p>
      <p>
        The school bowling team claimed an impressive victory in a friendly tournament held last Saturday at the local bowling center, outscoring teams from several neighboring schools. The win highlighted the team’s consistency, discipline, and teamwork throughout the competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bowlers set the tone early, opening the match with a series of controlled throws that resulted in multiple strikes and well-timed spares. Maintaining focus from frame to frame, the team steadily built a lead and kept their advantage through strong communication and mutual support on the lanes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite increasing pressure in the later rounds, the team remained composed. Accurate shots and steady scoring in the final frames proved decisive, allowing the school bowlers to secure the overall win. Their ability to stay calm under pressure played a key role in the outcome of the match.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the tournament, the coach praised the players for their commitment to training and their display of sportsmanship during the event. The victory not only boosted team morale but also generated greater interest among students, as bowling continues to gain recognition as a competitive school sport.
